# FTC-201718-2836

To summarize our robot, it was an omni-wheel driven chassis with a simple "putter" style mechanism for manipulating the game

This code is responsible for both the autonomous and tele-operated modes of the game, and more information about all of this
can be found over at www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc
